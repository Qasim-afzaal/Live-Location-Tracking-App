Welcome to the **Live Location Tracker**! This Flutter app tracks your live location, lets you set a destination, and draws the route between the two points using **OpenStreetMap** and **OSRM API**. It's like Google Maps, but cooler (and open-source)! üåç

## üß© How It Works

### 1. **Live Location Tracking**
   - The app uses the `geolocator` package to fetch your current location and updates the map in real-time. It‚Äôs like having a personal GPS in your pocket! üì±

### 2. **Destination Search**
   - Want to go somewhere? Type in the destination, and the app fetches its coordinates using the **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API**. A marker is added to the map so you know where you‚Äôre headed. üéØ

### 3. **Route Display**
   - The app uses the **OSRM API** to calculate the best route between your current location and the destination. The route is displayed as a blue line on the map. Follow the line, and you‚Äôll never get lost! üõ§Ô∏è

### 4. **Permissions**
   - The app ensures you‚Äôre in control. It asks for location permissions before accessing your device‚Äôs location. No shady business here! üîí
